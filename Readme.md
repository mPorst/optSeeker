# OPT Seeker
A small python library to help document, scan and search the files in the OPT mission folder that hold the function definitions which are most of the times files with the name `fnc_myFncName.sqf`.

## Version
0.0.1

## Specifications
What we want to do with this library. Can be used to create issues for features but for now it is just a collection of ideas to shape the project's future.

- [ ] Document the modules and function files within a module
- [ ] Document where each function is used and called (via (E)FUNC, and remoteExec(Call))
- [ ] Document outdated functions with old function header
- [ ] Create HTML or some visualization for each function header (API)
